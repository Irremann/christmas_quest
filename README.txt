christmas_quest mod by Irremann

The mod adds evil snowmen spawning in the snow and ice. After defeating them, you get a magical snowflake that you can exchange with Santa for gifts.
Santa must be installed manually in the place where you need (for example: spawn) from the account with the creative.

The list of contents of gifts should be looked for in init.lua from line 156. Now there are special winter armor, sweaters and fruits from farming mod.

todo: make time for snowmen to spawn and some way to remove santa.
